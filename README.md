i like rust 🦀
i hate go 🦫
trying to make some a free & open source alternative to burpsuite, and that's my life goal for now, and this github acc will be all about it, since i hate how slow and limited the free version are :)

anyways, i use rust 🦀, and im a linux fan/enjoyer/user 🐧
i use solus os don't ask me why, looking forward to gain some cybersecurity knowledge besides my computer science background 🖥️
